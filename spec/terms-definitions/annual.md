[[def: annual, annuals, Annual]]

~ An annual is a plant that completes its entire life cycle—from germination to seed production and death—within a single growing season. Annual plants invest all their energy into producing flowers and seeds before dying.

~ Common garden annuals include tomatoes, peppers, marigolds, and petunias. While they must be replanted each year, annuals often produce abundant flowers and fruits. See also [[ref: Germination]], [[ref: Seedling]], [[ref: Propagation]].
